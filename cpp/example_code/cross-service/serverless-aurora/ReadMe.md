## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
*  We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Prerequisites
*List prerequisites.* **<-- Delete this sentence from template**

## Create the resources 
*Writer can choose to use the CDK, console, or an SDK for their example. This section should be comprehensive and include every step. If using the console, images are helpful.* **<-- Delete this sentence from template** 

## Build the code
This example uses the poco library.
The poco library can be installed using Conan.
conan install .. --build=missing
*Varies by language, and clearly illustrates the workflow of building the app. Should include descriptions of code not included as code comments in actual examples.* **<-- Delete this sentence from template**

## Delete the resources

*This section should walk the user step-by-step through deleting the resources using the CDK. Or, if they created the resources manually, provide a reminder to delete them.* **<-- Delete this sentence from template**

To avoid charges, delete all the resources that you created for this tutorial.

If you created your resources through the AWS Management Console, or modified them by running the app, you must use the console to delete them.

If you created your resources using AWS CloudFormation, you can delete them by deleting the stack. For more information, see [Deleting a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html).

**Note**: By running the app, you modified the table and the bucket, so you must delete these resources manually through the console before you can delete the stack.
