https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sns-examples-subscribing-unubscribing-topics.html.

Purpose:
sns_listsubscriptions.js demonstrates how to retrieve a list of Amazon SNS subscriptions.

// snippet-start:[sns.JavaScript.v3.subscriptions.listSubscriptionsByTopic]

// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
const {SNS, ListSubscriptionsByTopicCommand} = require("@aws-sdk/client-sns");
// Set the AWS Region
const region = process.argv[2];
//Create SNS service object
const sns = new SNS(region);
// Set the parameters
const params = {TopicArn : process.argv[3]}

async function run() {
  try {
    const data = await sns.send(new ListSubscriptionsByTopicCommand(params));
    console.log("Success. Subscriptions:", data.Subscriptions);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err, err.stack);
