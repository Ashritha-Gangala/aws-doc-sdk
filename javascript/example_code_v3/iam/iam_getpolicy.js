ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS JavaScript SDK,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The pre-release version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/iam-examples-policies.html.

Purpose:
iam_getpolicy.js demonstrates how to retrieve information about an IAM managed policy.

Inputs (into command line below):
- REGION

Running the code:
node iam_getpolicy.js REGION
 */
// snippet-start:[iam.JavaScript.v3.policies.getPolicy]
// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
const {IAMClient, GetPolicyCommand} = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam");
// Set the AWS Region
const region = process.argv[2];
// Create IAM service object
const iam = new IAMClient(region);
// Set the parameters
const params = {
  PolicyArn: 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambdaExecute'
};

async function run() {
  try {
    const data = await iam.send(new GetPolicyCommand(params));
    console.log("Success", data.Policy.Description);
  }
  catch (err) {
  console.log("Error", err);
}
};
run();
// snippet-end:[iam.JavaScript.v3.policies.getPolicy]
exports.run = run; //for unit tests only
