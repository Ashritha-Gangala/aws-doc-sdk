const  {S3}  = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3/');
// Create S3 service object
const region = process.argv[2];
const s3 = new S3(region);
// Set the bucket parameters
const bucketParams = {Bucket: process.argv[3]};

async function run(){
    try {
        const data =  await s3.deleteBucketPolicy(bucketParams);
