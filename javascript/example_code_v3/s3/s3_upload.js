ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS JavaScript SDK,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The pre-release version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html.

Purpose:
s3_upload.js uploads a file to an S3 bucket.
Inputs:
- BUCKET_NAME (into command line below)
- KEY (into command line below): (optional)The Key parameter is set to the name of the selected file (existing or not), which you enter to run the code (see 'Running the code' below).
- BODY (into command line below): (optional)The Body parameter is the contents of the uploaded file. Leave blank/remove to retain contents of original file.
- FILE_NAME (into command line below): Name of the file to upload (if you don't specify KEY)
- REGION

Running the code:
node s3_upload.js REGION BUCKET_NAME KEY BODY FILE_NAME
