# Amazon Translate code examples for the AWS SDK for .NET v3

## Purpose

The following examples show how to use the Amazon Translate to build real-time and batch translation capabilities into applications written for the AWS SDK for .NET v3.

## ⚠️ Important

- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege, or at most the minimum
  permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide. 
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Code examples

### Single actions

- [Create a batch translation job](BatchTranslateExample/)
- [Describing a text translation job ](DescribingTextTranslationExample/)
- [Listing translation jobs](ListTranslationJobsExample/)

## Running the examples

After the example compiles, you can run it from the command line. To do so,
