# Amazon CloudWatch Code Examples in C\#

## Purpose

This folder contains examples that show how to use the AWS SDK for .NET 3.x to
get started working with CloudWatch features such as alarms and
dashboards.

## Code examples

- [DeleteAlarmsExample](DeleteAlarmsExample/) - Delete an existing CloudWatch alarm.
- [DescribeAlarmHistoriesExample](DescribeAlarmHistoriesExample/) - Retrieve information about existing CloudWatch alarms.
- [DisableAlarmActionsExample](DisableAlarmActionsExample/) - Disables actions for a specific CloudWatch alarm..
- [EnableAlarmActionsExample](EnableAlarmActionsExample/) - Enables actions for the a specific CloudWatch alarm.
- [GetDashboardExample](GetDashboardExample/) - Gets information for a CloudWatch dashboard.
- [ListDashboardsExample](ListDashboardsExample/) - Lists the dashboards created for an AWS Account.
- [ListMetricsExample](ListMetricsExample/) - List existing CloudWatch metrics defined for an AWS Account.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- .NET Core 
- AWS SDK for .NET 3.0 or later
- XUnit and Moq (to run unit tests)

## âš  Important
- We recommend that grant your code least privilege, or at most the minimum
  permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide. 
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
- Running the unit tests might result in charges to your AWS account. [optional]

## Running the examples

The examples in this folder use the default user account. The call to
initialize the Amazon SQS client supplies the region. Change the region to
match your own before running the example.

Once the example has been compiled, you can run it from the commandline by
first navigating to the folder that contains the .csproj file, and then
issuing the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Or you can execute the example from within your IDE.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than
individual API calls.
