# AWS STS code examples for the AWS SDK for .NET v3

## Overview

This folder contains examples for using the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) using the AWS SDK for .NET v3.

AWS STS creates private certificates for your internal resources and manages the certificate lifecycle.

## ⚠️ Important

- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege, or at most the minimum
  permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide. 
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are
  available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Code examples

### Single actions

- [Assuming a role](AssumeRole/)

## Running the examples

After the example compiles, you can run it from the command line. To do so,
navigating to the folder that contains the .csproj file, and run the following
command:

```
dotnet run
```

Alternatively, you can run the example from within your IDE.
