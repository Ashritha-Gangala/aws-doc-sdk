# Amazon DynamoDB code examples for the AWS SDK for Java V2

## Overview
This README discusses how to run and test the Java V2 code examples for Amazon DynamoDB.

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
*  We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
