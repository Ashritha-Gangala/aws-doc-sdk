# Lambda code examples for the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3)
## Overview
Shows how to create and manage AWS Lambda functions using the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3).
With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there's no charge when your code isn't running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
## Code examples
### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a function](lambda_basics.rb)

* [Delete a function](lambda_basics.rb)

* [Get a function](lambda_basics.rb)

* [Invoke a function](lambda_basics.rb)

* [List functions](lambda_basics.rb)

* [Update function code](lambda_basics.rb)

* [Update function configuration](lambda_basics.rb)


### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Get started with functions](scenario_getting_started_functions.rb)



## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

* An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.

* AWS credentials or an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) access token. For details, see [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.

* To run the code examples, Ruby version 1.9 or later. For Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on the Ruby Programming Language website.

* To test the code examples, RSpec 3.9 or later. For RSpec download and installation instructions, see the [rspec/rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) repository in GitHub.

* The AWS SDK for Ruby. For AWS SDK for Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Install the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-install.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.


### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking a [Scenario](#Scenarios) from your Command Line Interface (CLI). For example, `ruby some_scenario.rb` will invoke `some_scenario.rb`.
