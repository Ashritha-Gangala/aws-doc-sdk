# IAM Policies

These files are example IAM permission policies that show how to grant or deny permissions
to the resources in your AWS accounts.

## ⚠️ Usage disclaimer

**This example policies are not actively maintained!** For this reason, it is your responsibility to review each policy for its applicability to your environment 
and its completeness, both in terms of syntax and whether the sample provides a complete 
solution for your scenario. Because JSON does not support comments, these examples do not
have any kind of explanation accompanying them. We recommend that you view these examples 
in the context of our documentation. There you'll find a description for the example, 
often with an explanation of how the policy operates. 

Each file is formatted as JSON. For more information, see [Introducing JSON](https://json.org).

For more information about IAM and the policy language, see [Policies and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the IAM User Guide._
