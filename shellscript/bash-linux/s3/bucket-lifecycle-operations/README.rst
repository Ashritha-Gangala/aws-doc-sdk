Amazon S3 bucket lifecycle operations
#####################################

This example demonstrates how to interact with some of the basic Amazon S3 operations. The script
includes functions that perform the following tasks:

- Creating a bucket and verifying that it exists
- Copying a file from the local computer to a bucket
- Copying a file from one bucket location to a different bucket location
- Listing the contents of a bucket
- Deleting a file from a bucket
- Deleting a bucket

Running the example
===================

This example is written as functions in a shell script file (bucket-operations.sh) that 
can be sourced from another file. The file **bucket-operations-test.sh** script 
demonstrates how to call the functions by sourcing the **bucket-operations.sh** file and 
calling each of the functions.

If all steps work correctly, the test script removes all resources that it created.

To see the intermediate results of each step, remove the comment mark (#) in front of 
each of line that begins with a ``read`` command. Then when you run the script, you 
can view the current status of the bucket or its contents using the Amazon S3 console.

This example assumes that you have a shared credentials file with a default profile. For
more information about how to set up a shared credentials file, see `Configuration and 
Credential File Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html>`_
in the *AWS CLI User Guide*.
