# DynamoDB code examples for the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3)
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon DynamoDB database tables using the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3).

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions

* [Create a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Delete a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Delete an item from a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Get an item from a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Get information about a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Put an item in a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Query a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Scan a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Update an item in a table](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)

* [Write a batch of items](scenario_getting_started_movies.rb)



### Scenarios

## Run the examples


### Prerequisites

1. An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.

1. AWS credentials or an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) access token. For details, see [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.

1. To run the code examples, Ruby version 1.9 or later. For Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on the Ruby Programming Language website.

1. To test the code examples, RSpec 3.9 or later. For RSpec download and installation instructions, see the [rspec/rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) repository in GitHub.

1. The AWS SDK for Ruby. For AWS SDK for Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Install the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-install.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.



### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking a [Scenario](#Scenarios) from your Command Line Interface (CLI). For example, `ruby some_scenario.rb` will invoke `some_scenario.rb`.
