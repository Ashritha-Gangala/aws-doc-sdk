# CodeBuild code examples for the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3)
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage AWS CodeBuild workflows using the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3).

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the examples


### Prerequisites

1. An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.

1. AWS credentials or an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) access token. For details, see [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.

1. To run the code examples, Ruby version 1.9 or later. For Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on the Ruby Programming Language website.

1. To test the code examples, RSpec 3.9 or later. For RSpec download and installation instructions, see the [rspec/rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) repository in GitHub.

1. The AWS SDK for Ruby. For AWS SDK for Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Install the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-install.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.



### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking individual [Actions](#Actions) from your Command Line Interface (CLI). This may require some modification to override hard-coded values, and some actions also expect runtime parameters. For example, `ruby some_action.rb ARG1 ARG2` will invoke `some_action.rb` with two arguments.

## Contributing
Code examples thrive on community contribution!

* To propose a new example, submit an [Enhancement Request](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E) (~2 min).
* To fix a bug, submit a [Bug Report](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fbug&template=bug.yaml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E) (~5 min).
