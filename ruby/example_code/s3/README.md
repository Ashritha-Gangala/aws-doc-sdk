# S3 code examples for the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3)
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets using the AWS SDK for Ruby (v3).

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the examples


### Prerequisites

1. An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.

1. AWS credentials or an AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) access token. For details, see [Configuring the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.

1. To run the code examples, Ruby version 1.9 or later. For Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on the Ruby Programming Language website.

1. To test the code examples, RSpec 3.9 or later. For RSpec download and installation instructions, see the [rspec/rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) repository in GitHub.

1. The AWS SDK for Ruby. For AWS SDK for Ruby download and installation instructions, see [Install the AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-install.html) in the *AWS SDK for Ruby Developer Guide*.



### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking a [Scenario](#Scenarios) from your Command Line Interface (CLI). For example, `ruby some_scenario.rb` will invoke `some_scenario.rb`.
