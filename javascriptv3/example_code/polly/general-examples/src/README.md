# TypeScript environment for Amazon Polly examples
This is a workspace where you can find working AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3) Amazon Polly examples. 

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is available. 

The [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 API Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-polly/index.html) contains the API operations for the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 Amazon Polly client module.

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, 
and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. 
 
**NOTE:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 is written in TypeScript so, for consistency, these examples are also 
in TypeScript. TypeScript extends JavaScript so these examples can also be run as JavaScript. 
For more information, see [TypeScript homepage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Getting started

1. Clone the [AWS SDK Code Samples repo](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) to your local environment. See [the Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for instructions.

2. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json.

**Note**: These dependencies include the client module for the AWS services required in these example, 
which are *@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity*, *@aws-sdk/credential-provider-cognito-identity*,
and *@aws-sdk/client-polly*.

```
npm install ts-node -g # If using JavaScript, enter 'npm install node -g' instead
cd javascriptv3/example_code/polly
npm install
```
3. If you're using JavaScript, change the sample file extension from ```.ts``` to ```.js```.

4. In your text editor, update the user variables specified in the ```Inputs``` section of the sample file.

5. Run sample code:
```
cd src
ts-node [example name].ts # For example, ts-node polly_synthesize_to_s3.ts
```
