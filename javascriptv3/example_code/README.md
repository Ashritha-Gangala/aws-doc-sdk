# AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) code examples
## Overview
The code examples in this topic show you how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) with AWS.

The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 provides a JavaScript API for AWS infrastructure services. Using the SDK, you can build applications on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

## Types of code examples
* **Single-service actions** - Code examples that show you how to call individual service functions.

* **Single-service scenarios** - Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* **Cross-service examples** - Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

### Find code examples
Single-service actions and scenarios are organized by AWS service in this folder. A README in each folder lists and describes how to run the examples.

Cross-service examples are located in the [*cross-services folder*](./cross-services). A README in each folder describes how to run the example.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* We recommend that you grant your code the least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).


### Prerequisites
* Latest stable version of Node.js
* A shared configurations file with your user credentials. See the [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html) for more information.

## Tests
**Note**: Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

A description of how to run the unit tests, and a note to see the service level/cross-service level for specific instructions.
