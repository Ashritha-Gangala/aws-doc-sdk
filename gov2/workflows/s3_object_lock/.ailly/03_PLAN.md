  Create a plan to implement this workflow in the Go programming language. Include a go.mod file, and folders for actions, cmd, stubs, and workflows.
  Use snake case for file names.
  The actions folder should contain an S3Actions struct to wrap the service action methods and a test file to test the S3Actions wrapper.
  The cmd folder should contain a main function.
  The stubs folder should contain testing stubs for the service actions.
  The workflows folder should contain the interactive program that runs the object lock workflow.
  Describe the files that we will need as a powershell script to create their outline.

```powershell
# Create the project directory
mkdir go-s3-object-lock-example
Set-Location go-s3-object-lock-example

# Initialize a new Go module
go mod init example.com/go-s3-object-lock

# Create go.mod file
"module example.com/go-s3-object-lock" | Out-File -FilePath go.mod

# Create folders
mkdir actions
mkdir cmd
mkdir stubs
mkdir workflows

# Actions folder
$actionsFiles = @(
    "s3_actions.go"
    "s3_actions_test.go"
)

foreach ($file in $actionsFiles) {
    ni $file --item 0
}

# Cmd folder
$cmdFiles = @(
    "main.go"
)

foreach ($file in $cmdFiles) {
    ni $file --item 0
}

# Stubs folder
$stubsFiles = @(
    "s3_stubs.go"
)

foreach ($file in $stubsFiles) {
    ni $file --item 0
}

# Workflows folder
$workflowsFiles = @(
    "object_lock_workflow.go"
)

foreach ($file in $workflowsFiles) {
    ni $file --item 0
}
```

This PowerShell script will create the required directory structure and files for the Go S3 Object Lock workflow example. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. Creates a new directory called `go-s3-object-lock-example`.
2. Initializes a new Go module with `go mod init example.com/go-s3-object-lock`.
3. Creates a `go.mod` file with the module declaration.
4. Creates the following folders: `actions`, `cmd`, `stubs`, and `workflows`.
5. In the `actions` folder, it creates two files: `s3_actions.go` and `s3_actions_test.go`. The `s3_actions.go` file will contain an `S3Actions` struct to wrap the service action methods, and `s3_actions_test.go` will contain tests for the `S3Actions` wrapper.
6. In the `cmd` folder, it creates a single file `main.go`, which will contain the `main` function for the application.
7. In the `stubs` folder, it creates a file `s3_stubs.go`, which will contain testing stubs for the S3 service actions.
8. In the `workflows` folder, it creates a file `object_lock_workflow.go`, which will contain the interactive program that runs the object lock workflow.

After running this script, you'll have the basic file structure in place, and you can start implementing the actual code for the S3 Object Lock workflow example in Go.
