## Usecases

In the use_cases folder, find step-by-step development tutorials that use multiple AWS services and the AWS SDK for Kotlin. By following these tutorials, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create Kotlin applications that use the AWS SDK for Kotlin. These tutorials include:

+ [Create a React and Spring REST application that queries Amazon DynamoDB data](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/usecases/itemtracker_dynamodb) - Discusses how to develop a Spring REST API that queries Amazon DynamoDB data. The Spring REST API uses the AWS SDK for Kotlin to invoke AWS services and is used by a React application that displays the data.

+ [Creating a React and Spring REST application that queries Amazon Redshift data](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/usecases/itemtracker_dynamodb) - Discusses how to develop a Spring REST API that queries Amazon Redshift data. The Spring REST API uses the AWS SDK for Kotlin to invoke AWS services and is used by a React application that displays the data.

+ `Creating a React and Spring REST application that queries Amazon Aurora data <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/usecases/serverless_rds>`_  - Discusses how to develop a Spring REST API that queries Amazon Aurora data. The Spring REST API uses the AWS SDK for Kotlin to invoke AWS services and is used by a React application that displays the data.

+ `Creating an example Photo analyzer application using the AWS SDK for Kotlin <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/usecases/creating_photo_analyzer_app>`_ - Discusses using the AWS SDK for Kotlin and various AWS services, such as the Amazon Rekognition service, to analyze images. This application analyzes many images and generates a report that breaks down each image into a series of labels.

+ `Creating AWS serverless workflows using the AWS SDK for Kotlin<https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/usecases/creating_workflows_stepfunctions>`_ **** - A tutorial that discusses using the AWS SDK for Kotlin and AWS Step Functions to create a workflow that invokes AWS services. Each workflow step is implemented by using an AWS Lambda function.

+ **Creating a dynamic web application that analyzes photos using the AWS SDK for Kotlin** - A tutorial that discusses using the AWS SDK for Kotlin and various AWS services, such as the Amazon Rekognition service, to analyze images. The application can analyze many images and generate a report that breaks down each image into a series of labels.

+ **Creating a Spring Boot Application that has publish-subscribe functionality** - A tutorial that discusses how to create a web application that has subscription and publish functionality. In this tutorial, the Spring Framework along with AWS SDK for Kotlin is used to create the application.

+ **Creating a publish-subscribe Android application that translates messages using the AWS SDK for Kotlin** - A tutorial that discusses how to create a native Android application that has subscription and publish functionality.
